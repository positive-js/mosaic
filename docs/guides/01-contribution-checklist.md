# Contribution checklist

Please make sure you have created an issue to discuss the contribution following our [guide](./00-contributing.md).

## Development

There's a few aspects of development we'll cover here:

* Documentation
* Review
* Testing

### Documenting

When documenting a component, there's two things you need to worry about:

* Docs - general documentation for the component.
* Storybook - interactive use-cases showing how to use the component.

### Testing

The following types of tests are required for all packages:

* Unit test

Your component may also require further testing:

* Integration test       (work in progress)
* Functional test        (work in progress)
* Visual regression test (work in progress)
* Performance test       (work in progress)

On top of automated testing, we should also be manually testing our examples on the following platforms / browsers:

* Windows
  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Edge
  * Mac
  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari

## Review

* Ensure a core maintainer is added to the review.
